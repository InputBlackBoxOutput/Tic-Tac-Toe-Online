		<h4> The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row, column or diagonal.</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>You play on a three by three game board.</li>

			<li>The first player is known as X and the second is O.</li>

			<li>Players alternately place Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row/column/diagonal or all nine squares are filled.</li>

			<li>X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.</li>
